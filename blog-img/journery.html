    <h1>Manisha's Coding Journey &#128187</h1>
    <p class="one">
      As a non-coder when I entered college to pursue BCA, I was initially
      daunted by the world of programming and technology. However, instead of
      shying away, I decided to take on the challenge head-on. I began my
      journey with the basics of C language and gradually expanded my horizons
      to delve into web development and SQL. It wasn't an easy path; I faced
      numerous obstacles and moments of self-doubt, but I refused to give up.
    </p>

    <p class="one">
      I dedicated myself to daily practice and spent countless hours honing my
      skills. With each small success, my confidence grew, and I became more
      eager to explore new realms in the programming world. Through online
      resources, tutorials, and coding communities, I self-taught various
      programming languages and acquired the knowledge necessary to excel in
      both competitive programming and software development.
    </p>

    <p class="one">
      Looking back, I am proud of how far I have come. From a complete novice to
      a capable coder, I have proven to myself that determination and
      perseverance can overcome any initial limitations. This journey has not
      only shaped my technical abilities but also instilled in me the value of
      continuous learning and adaptability.
    </p>

    <p class="one">
      Now, equipped with a diverse skill set, I am excited about the endless
      possibilities that lie ahead in the tech industry. I have transformed my
      passion for coding into a potential career, and I am eager to contribute
      my skills and knowledge to meaningful projects.
    </p>

    <p class="one">
      Though the road had its share of challenges and setbacks, I can
      confidently say that it was all worth it. My journey from a non-coder to a
      proficient programmer is a testament to the power of resilience,
      self-motivation, and the desire to never stop learning. I am grateful for
      every step of this adventure and excited for what the future holds as I
      continue to grow and evolve in the world of technology.
