            <br>
           <p>I am Manisha, a final year MCA student at CIITM Jaipur,
            eager to make a meaningful impact in the world of technology. As a
            BCA pass-out with a strong foundation in problem-solving and a focus
            on honing my skills in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Full
            Stack Development, I am poised to contribute to innovative projects
            and excel in the industry.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a deep passion for
            problem-solving and have dedicated my time to mastering DSA concepts
            with C++ as my preferred programming language. I am constantly
            seeking opportunities to apply my skills and expand my knowledge in
            creating efficient algorithms and data structures that optimize
            performance. Moreover, my enthusiasm for Full Stack Development has
            allowed me to gain practical experience in building dynamic and
            user-friendly web applications.
          </p>
         <br>
          <p>
            I am well-versed in front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript, as well as back-end frameworks like Node.js and
            Express.js. I am constantly exploring new technologies and
            frameworks to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Apart from technical expertise, I possess strong leadership
            qualities that have been nurtured through various team projects and
            group activities. I believe in fostering collaboration and driving
            team synergy to achieve common goals. As a proactive learner, I am
            always open to new challenges and thrive in an environment that
            encourages continuous growth and learning.
          </p>
         <br>
          <p>
            If you are looking for a motivated and dedicated individual with a
            strong foundation in DSA, Full Stack Development, and
            problem-solving skills, I would love to connect with you. Let's
            explore how we can contribute to the world of technology together
            and make a lasting impact. Feel free to reach out to me through
            LinkedIn or in the contact me section. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
